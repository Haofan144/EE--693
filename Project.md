2. A research work including a novel idea and protocol/system design related to the survery topic. 
3. An implemenation of your idea and comparison with existing work.

The length of your final report is 10-12 pages (single-column) or 5-6 pages (double-column) using a font size of 10 pt. If you choose the double-column format, it is recommended that you use an ACM or IEEE [template](). 



Each student must write his/her own term paper with his/her own sentences, analytical thinking, and ideas, emphasizing his/her own contribution.  Copying and pasting from someone else's paper will constitute plagiarism. The use of someone else's phrases or sentences should be attributed and shown as a quotation.

Every student is recommended to discuss with the instructor before determining his/her project topic.
