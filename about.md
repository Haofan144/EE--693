## Course Description

This course focuses on the networking aspects of wireless networks and Internet of Things: protocols at the various layers and how they answer the specific requirements posed by these networks (e.g., data driven, energy efficient, etc.) and their applications (monitoring, tracking, etc.). Explores how physical layer and hardware issues may influence protocol design. 


## Prerequisites
EE 368 is recommended as a prerequisite.

## Textbook (Optional)
Krishnamurthy Raghunandan, [Introduction to Wireless Communications and Networks: A Practical Perspective](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-92188-0), 1st edition, Springer Cham, 2022, ISBN: 978-3-030-92187-3

- There are 9 presentations in total and you should submit no fewer than 15 reading reports.(Papers can be found [here](../paper%20list))

- Each report will be graded as a check- (1pt), check (1.5pt), or check+ (2pt).

- You may submit more but we only count the 15 reports with highest grades.

## Reading Reports

Each lecture will have one or two assigned readings, which we will all read prior to the class. All students are expected to have thoroughly read the paper, and come to class ready to discuss them in detail. This is essential to get the most out of the class!

Submit hard copy of your reading reports before every paper presentation. Eg: We will talk about Sensor data collection and aggregation on week 3, if you want to write a review for “Sparse Data Aggregation in Sensor Networks”, you should submit it before the class 

## In-class Presentation

Each student will also be assigned one paper to present to the class during the semester. The presentation should roughly be 45 minutes. Keep the following questions in mind to help you structure your presentation:

- What problem is the paper solving and why is it important?

- What is the main idea of the paper?

- How does the paper differ from previous work?

- Are there any flaws in the paper? How would you improve the paper or build on it in future work?

## Participation

We expect you to attend all lectures, unless there are pressing or unforeseen conflicts. Conflicts that are persistent (e.g., registering for another class at the same time and “splitting” attendance between them) are not excused.
