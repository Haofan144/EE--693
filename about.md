## Course Description

This course focuses on the networking aspects of wireless networks and Internet of Things: protocols at the various layers and how they answer the specific requirements posed by these networks (e.g., data driven, energy efficient, etc.) and their applications (monitoring, tracking, etc.). Explores how physical layer and hardware issues may influence protocol design.
